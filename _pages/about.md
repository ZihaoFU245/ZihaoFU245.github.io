## Who I Am

I'm **Zihao Fu**, a passionate and driven Computer Science student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). My journey in technology is fueled by a deep curiosity for how things work and a desire to build innovative solutions.

## My Journey

My academic and personal experiences have shaped my perspective and skills:

-   **Global Exposure:** I had the wonderful opportunity to study abroad in **Madrid** during high school, an experience that broadened my horizons and taught me to embrace new cultures and challenges.
-   **Summer at Berkeley:** I furthered my knowledge in Mathematics and Computer Science during a summer session at **UC Berkeley** in 2025.
-   **Ongoing:** Read my blog. It updates more frequently than any other page.

## What Drives Me

Every project started as something fun for me or for my younger self.
