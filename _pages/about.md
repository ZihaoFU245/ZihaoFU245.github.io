## Who I Am

Hello! I'm **Zihao**, a passionate and driven Computer Science student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). My journey in technology is fueled by a deep curiosity for how things work and a desire to build innovative solutions.

## My Journey

My academic and personal experiences have shaped my perspective and skills:

-   **Global Exposure:** I had the wonderful opportunity to study abroad in **Madrid** during high school, an experience that broadened my horizons and taught me to embrace new cultures and challenges.
-   **Summer at Berkeley:** I furthered my knowledge in Mathematics and Computer Science during a summer session at **UC Berkeley** in 2025.
-   **Current Focus:** My primary interests lie in the exciting fields of **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and **Game Development**. I'm currently diving into **Unity** and have already started creating some simple games to hone my skills.

## What Drives Me

I'm not just an engineer in training; I'm a creator at heart. Whether it's designing an intelligent system or building an interactive game, I am constantly seeking opportunities to learn, grow, and make a positive impact through technology.
