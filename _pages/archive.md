## Projects

Below are some notable projects. For full details and links, see the repositories.

- A Tile Engine 2D and a demo game uses it — Data structures, algorithms: AABB, Hash Grid, A* shortest path, etc — [Repo](
    https://github.com/ZihaoFU245/2DTileEngine
)
    * This is currently using StdDraw -- an education used package, using CPU for rendering
    I will change it to use LWJGL with GPU support
    * Audio System is missing, will be added in future version
    * Switching to other backing rendering package may introduce better animation, faster run time
    * Now only has collision system, no real physics
    * I made the engine for a project at Berkeley
    * Above are only release 0.0.0 on 08/08/2025, check the repo for latest updates, star it!
- Friday AI Assistant — Modular skill-based assistant with MCP server (Python, FastAPI, React, Electron) — [Repo](https://github.com/ZihaoFU245/It-s-Friday-)
	- Built in June 2025 connecting MCP servers with an Agents (OpenAI Agents SDK)
	- Backend via LiteLLM (Python). Considering a lower-latency Rust path (TensorZero) later.
- Music Player App — PySide6, python-vlc — [Repo](https://github.com/ZihaoFU245/Acoustic-Player)
	- First large project; great learning experience.
- Machine Learning Projects
	1. Spam email classification (Naive Bayes)
	2. Titanic (MLP)
	3. California house price (MLP)
	4. Iris Flower (K-Means + KNN)
	5. MNIST (MLP / CNN)
	6. Butterfly classification (CNN) — dataset from Kaggle
	7. Connect Four AI (MiniMax)
	8. Mini AutoPilot at HKUST (CNN, OpenCV)
