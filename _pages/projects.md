## Notable Projects

- **Friday AI Assistant:** Modular skill-based assistant with MCP server (Python, FastAPI, React, Electron) — [Repo link](https://github.com/ZihaoFU245/It-s-Friday-)
    * Did it in June 2025 connecting MCP servers with an Agents (OpenAi-Agents-SDK)
    * The OpenAI agents sdk is using LiteLLM for it's backend, which all written in Python, the latency to super high, bad user experience. TensorZero (Rust) might done a better job. I will try that out in future.
- **Music Player App:** PySide6, python-vlc — [Repo link](https://github.com/ZihaoFU245/Acoustic-Player)
    * This is my first big project, a bit rustly for the first time. But the experience i gain is most important.
- **Machine Learning Projs** 
    1. Span email classification (naive Bayes)
    2. Titanic (MLP)
    3. California house price (MLP)
    4. Iris Flower (K-Means + KNN)
    5. MNIST (MLP / CNN)
    6. Butterfly classification (CNN)
        * Found the dataset on kaggle
    7. Connect Four AI (MiniMax)
    8. Mini AutoPilot at HKUST (CNN, OpenCV)
