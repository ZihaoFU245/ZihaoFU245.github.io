## üö® Current Issue

The website at https://zihaofu245.github.io/ is displaying the raw source of `index.html` (including YAML front-matter and Liquid tags) instead of a properly rendered Jekyll page.

**Diagnosis:**  
- The Jekyll build process is not running or not being recognized, so Liquid tags and YAML front-matter are not processed.  
- This results in the browser showing unrendered template code.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Resolution Steps

### 1. **Fix Front-Matter in HTML Pages**

- Each HTML file (especially `index.html`, `resume.html`, `projects.html`) must start with a *multi-line* YAML block, **not** a single line.
- Example:
  ```yaml
  ---
  layout: default
  title: "Home"
  ---


### If using **GitHub Actions**:
Create `.github/workflows/pages.yml` with the following steps:
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/configure-pages@v5
      - uses: actions/jekyll-build-pages@v1
        with:
          source: ./
          destination: ./_site
      - uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pages: write
      id-token: write
```
