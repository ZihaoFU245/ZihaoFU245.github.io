  remote_theme: "mmistakes/minimal-mistakes@latest"
  plugins:
    - jekyll-include-cache

  minimal_mistakes_skin: "default" # Options: default, dark, air, mint, etc.
  repository: "ZihaoFU245/ZihaoFU245.github.io"

  author:
    name: "Zihao []"
    avatar: "/assets/images/profile.jpg"
    bio: "Engineer, Computer Science student at HKUST. Interested in AI, systems, and more."
    location: "[]"
    email: "[]"
    github: "ZihaoFU245"

    # Add more fields as needed

### 5. **Add Assets Folder (Optional)**
