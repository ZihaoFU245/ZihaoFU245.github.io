## Reason for building this

In summer 2025 at Berkeley, I took 61BL and the final project was "BYOW" (Build Your Own World).
I decided to make a game inspired by Unity and build my own engine from scratch, including
collision and tile mapping. The demo game in the repo is what I submitted, and it earned full marks.
