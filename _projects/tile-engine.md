## Reason doing this

I was in Berkely summer 2025, took 61BL and the last project is "BYOW",
Build your own world. And i decided to make a game, but inspired by Unity. I want 
to make my own engine, handle collision, tile map all myself. Then I made this engine. 
The demo game in repo is the game i handed, which got me full mark:)
