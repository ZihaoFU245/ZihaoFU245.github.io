Modular skill-based assistant with an MCP server backend (Python, FastAPI, React, Electron). Key points:

- **MCP-connected Agents SDK integration**
- **Uses LiteLLM as the model backend** (experimenting with TensorZero/Rust later)
- **Designed for extensible skills and local-first execution**

## Status
I decided not to continue working on this repo, but the project is still **alive!** The new project has a nickname: **Aurora**, which is now in very good shape.  
**Why did I change the repo?**
- This repo's structure was too bad. After gaining experience in software engineering, I realized I should create a better, cleaner structure.
- I focused too much on making tools and thinking too big. The two weeks I spent on this project were mostly dedicated to creating tools (Agent tools) rather than the orchestration itself, which **deviated** from the original goal.

## Reason for doing this?

**June 2025**: I finished the Spring term. AI applications were thriving, and I heard that on **July 17th**, GPT-5 was going to be released with lots of connectors, becoming a real agent. But actually, the release was delayed, and the functions I expected did not come, such as email replies and MCP server support. **CLAUDE** can do that!  
Right back on track: I rested at home and watched some old movies. One of them was **Iron Man**, such a classic. I wondered, "In 2025, with LLMs, that could be realized!" That was it—I started working on this, digging into AI Engineering!
