> I am a graduated King's college students at 2024. Back in old days (2022 fall to 2023 spring), we have some 
tricks to bypass some of the blocking list and gain access to pages like coolmathgames, 
but now this method is entirely blocked though a hard reboot of all the chromebooks.
And recently heard that youtube is entirely blocked. But smart students would always come up 
with ideas to bypass the restrictions. No games in class? No way! 

## This page rules
1. **If you have any ideas / thoughts that can help this page, email me.**
2. **Do not distribute the url to people you don't trust.**
3. **Don't play it too often. The IT team knows what url you have visited.**
4. **Keep this url within secondary students.**
5. **Hopefully, this site can last a year without being blocked.**
6. **Open to contributes: If you wrote a game, of course it can be runned locally, but it would be generous to share. I will put you in a contribution list.**

## At Last
<b>
There are, what i know, 3 ways to access to game in class.</b>

1. Find game websites:
	- Not easy to find an unblocked domain, populars are already banned.
	- Easy for most students to play, just goto the url.
	- A large collections
2. Local games, not executables, *.html files instead along with css/js
	- Not friendly for students without a cs background
	- Techenically, it is ok to open a local html file on chromebook
	- Lack of varieties.
	- It is impossible for IT team to block. I will gather a collection of downloadable games if most users want. An alternative solution for blocking, yet powerful.
3. Use your own device
	- risky

### What this page does?

<b>
At least I know my domain is not blocked `zihaofu245.me`, so I can make a collection website myself. 
A combination for 1 and 2.
