# Weekly review, what happened?

> Another few weeks passed at HKUST. This post is continued from Sep 7th - [first week back in HK]({% post_url 2025-09-07-first_week_uni %})

## What's fun

If you've been checking my website regularly, you might think there haven't been any updates—no new posts, no new projects. But that's not entirely true.

**I've been secretly working on something new!**

A brand new landing page — [Check it out here](/hehehehaw)

It's now in great shape, with a growing collection of resources. I designed it specifically for my college friends and their needs.

**And there's more!**

I partnered with <a href="mailto:shengwxnw@gmail.com">shengwxnw</a> to create a **network request routing service**. We're leveraging the free tier offered by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) Workers to send requests locally, with the Workers fetching URLs and returning the information to us. However, it's not as powerful as a full **VPN** solution.

> Note: Some websites have blocked visitors from Cloudflare IP addresses, which is a significant disadvantage.

You can check out our **Local Connector Prototypes** [here](https://shengwxnw.github.io).

I made it a VPN / Linux server.

## What's Boring

**Assignments**: Linear Algebra, Discrete math, Circuit design, UML Diagram

The term officially kicks off, becoming more busy

## Where I spent most of my time

I am watching **Strangers Things**, such a good one. I am now onto **season 03**. Jim Hopper Live!

## Storm is coming
