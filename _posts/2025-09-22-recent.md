# Weekly review, what happened?

> Another few weeks passed at HKUST. This post is continued from Sep 7th - [first week back in HK]({% post_url 2025-09-07-first_week_uni %})

## What's fun

If you've been checking my website regularly, you might think there haven't been any updates—no new posts, no new projects. But that's not entirely true.

**I've been secretly working on something new!**

A brand new landing page — [Check it out here](/hehehehaw)

It's now in great shape, with a growing collection of resources. I designed it specifically for my college friends and their needs.

**And there's more!**

I partnered with <a href="mailto:shengwxnw@gmail.com">shengwxnw</a>, [sergio's Portfolio](https://shengwxnw.github.io/), to create a **network request routing service**. We're leveraging the free tier offered by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) Workers to send requests locally, with the Workers fetching URLs and returning the information to us. However, it's not as powerful as a full **VPN** solution.

> Note: Some websites have blocked visitors from Cloudflare IP addresses, which is a significant disadvantage.

> Comment at 12/6/2025: This idea is utterly naive. Albeit it is viable, the effort is huge. I soon turned into another solution,
[neko](https://github.com/m1k1o/neko), a virtual browser. To proxy in a browser tab, there are so many things that needs to consider. 
How to render css? How to run js? How to handle relative url? How to handle redirect? That's why the above idea did not workout. 
The ultimate solution I found is stream the browser live. Further thinking, use rustdesk web to use computer at your home. 

You can check out our **Local Connector Prototypes** [here](https://shengwxnw.github.io).

> The local connector has been removed now, it supposed to be a static website that served through github pages

I made it a VPN / Linux server.

## What's Boring

**Assignments**: Linear Algebra, Discrete math, Circuit design, UML Diagram

The term officially kicks off, becoming more busy

## Where I spent most of my time

I am watching **Strangers Things**, such a good one. I am now onto **season 03**. Jim Hopper Live!

## Storm is coming
