# 🎉 2DTileEngine is Now Open Source! 🚀

I'm excited to announce that my lightweight 2D Tile Engine, [2DTileEngine](https://github.com/ZihaoFU245/2DTileEngine), is now open source!

## What is 2DTileEngine?
A simple, tile-based engine built in Java for learning, tinkering, and creative projects. It features:
- Scene stack with transitions
- Fixed-timestep game loop
- Camera and viewport rendering
- Spatial-hash collisions
- Input handling (keyboard, command bar)
- Demo game with themes, pathfinding, and more

## Who is it for?
This project is **mainly for hobbyists and students**—anyone curious about how game engines work, or looking for a fun way to experiment with 2D games. No need to be a professional developer!

## How to Get Started
- **Requirements:** Java 23+, algs4.jar (included)
- **Quick Start:**
  1. Clone the repo
  2. Compile with `javac -cp lib\algs4.jar -d out (Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter *.java | %% { $_.FullName })`
  3. Run the demo: `java -cp "out;lib/algs4.jar" core.Main`
- See [docs/GettingStarted.md](https://github.com/ZihaoFU245/2DTileEngine/blob/master/docs/GettingStarted.md) for more!

## Highlights
- Playable demo game included
- Easy to extend: add your own scenes, entities, and themes
- Well-documented for learning and hacking
- Fun command bar and theme system

## Why Open Source?
I believe in learning by doing—and sharing! By open sourcing this engine, I hope to help others explore game development basics, experiment, and maybe even build something cool.
