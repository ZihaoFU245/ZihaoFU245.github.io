<h2 id="what-is-tailscale">What is Tailscale?</h2>

<p>Tailscale is a zero-config VPN that creates a secure network between your computers, servers, and cloud instances — even when separated by firewalls and subnets. It’s built on top of WireGuard®, which means you get the speed and security of a modern VPN protocol without the setup complexity.</p>

<p>For me, it meant I could finally connect all my devices, including my Raspberry Pi and a few cloud VMs from DigitalOcean, into a single, private “tailnet”.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started-with-tailscale">Getting Started with Tailscale</h2>

<p>Getting started with Tailscale was mostly straightforward, but I did run into a few configuration hurdles like enabling IP forwarding and disabling Generic Receive Offload (GRO) to get everything working smoothly.</p>

<p>Here’s a breakdown of how I set up my tailnet, which might help you get started as well.</p>

<h3 id="1-installing-tailscale">1. Installing Tailscale</h3>

<p>The first step is to install Tailscale on all the devices you want to connect. Tailscale has clients for almost every operating system.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Go to the Tailscale download page:</strong> <a href="https://tailscale.com/download">tailscale.com/download</a></li>
  <li><strong>Download and install the client</strong> for your OS (Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, etc.).</li>
  <li><strong>Log in:</strong> After installation, you’ll be prompted to log in with a Google, Microsoft, or GitHub account. Use the same account on all your devices to add them to the same tailnet.</li>
</ol>

<p>For my Raspberry Pi, I used the command line to install it:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>curl <span class="nt">-fsSL</span> https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="2-advertising-a-subnet-like-a-home-network">2. Advertising a Subnet (like a home network)</h3>

<p>One of the most powerful features of Tailscale is the ability to use a device as a gateway to a whole subnet. This is what I did with my Raspberry Pi to access my home network from anywhere.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Enable IP forwarding on the gateway device (e.g., your Raspberry Pi).</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>On Linux, you can do this by running:
        <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s1">'net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1'</span> | <span class="nb">sudo tee</span> <span class="nt">-a</span> /etc/sysctl.d/99-tailscale.conf
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s1">'net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding = 1'</span> | <span class="nb">sudo tee</span> <span class="nt">-a</span> /etc/sysctl.d/99-tailscale.conf
<span class="nb">sudo </span>sysctl <span class="nt">-p</span> /etc/sysctl.d/99-tailscale.conf
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Advertise the subnet route.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>First, connect your device to your tailnet by running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo tailscale up</code>.</li>
      <li>Then, use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tailscale set</code> command to advertise the route. You’ll need to know the IP range of your local network (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">192.168.1.0/24</code>).
        <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>tailscale <span class="nb">set</span> <span class="nt">--advertise-routes</span><span class="o">=</span>192.168.1.0/24
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Approve the routes in the Tailscale admin console.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Go to the <a href="https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines">Tailscale admin console</a>.</li>
      <li>You will see your device with a “Subnet routes” badge. Click on it and approve the advertised routes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="3-using-an-exit-node">3. Using an Exit Node</h3>

<p>An exit node allows you to route all your internet traffic through another device on your tailnet. This is useful for securing your traffic on public Wi-Fi or accessing geo-restricted content. I set up one of my DigitalOcean VMs as an exit node.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Advertise a device as an exit node.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>On the device you want to be the exit node, run:
        <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>tailscale <span class="nb">set</span> <span class="nt">--advertise-exit-node</span>
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Approve the exit node in the admin console.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Go to the admin console, find the machine, and approve it as an exit node.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Use the exit node from another device.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>On any other device in your tailnet, you can now choose to route your traffic through the exit node. You can enable this from the Tailscale client menu.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>With Tailscale, I now have a secure, private network that connects my Raspberry Pi, my laptops, my phone, and my cloud servers. It’s been a game-changer for accessing my devices and services from anywhere in the world. If you’re looking for a simple and powerful way to create your own private network, I highly recommend giving Tailscale a try.</p>]]></content><author><name>Zihao Fu</name><email>zihaofu12@gmail.com</email></author><category term="General" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[My Journey to a Seamless Private Network with Tailscale It all started with a Raspberry Pi.

  <p>Written on 12th Sep 2025, after spending an afternoon figuring out how to use both Git LFS and deploy to GitHub Pages. An ultimate shortcut guide.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>TL;DR: GitHub Pages does not auto-fetch Git LFS objects. You must fetch LFS files during your build/deploy step (e.g., GitHub Actions) so that the files in your publish branch (often gh-pages) are real binaries, not LFS pointer text files. Then set Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: Deploy from a branch and choose your gh-pages branch.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<figure>
	<img src="/assets/2025-09-12-resources/teaser.svg" alt="Flow: repo → Git LFS (media pointers) → gh-pages deployment with large assets tracked separately" style="width:100%;max-width:880px;display:block;margin:0 auto;" />
	<figcaption style="text-align:center;font-size:0.85rem;color:#64748b;margin-top:.4rem;">Light theme overview: keep source light, store heavy binaries via Git LFS, deploy cleanly to GitHub Pages.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h1 id="why-lfs--pages">Why LFS + Pages?</h1>

<p>GitHub Pages is great for static sites (personal sites, docs, game pages). Git LFS keeps your main repo light by storing big binaries (videos, large images, game builds) in a separate object store and committing <strong>pointers</strong> instead. The trick is deployment: Pages serves whatever is <strong>committed</strong> in the publish branch. <strong>If you push LFS pointers there, your site will show broken images.</strong> If you push the <strong>resolved binaries</strong>, it will work.</p>

<p>In this guide you’ll set up a workflow where your Pages site (often served from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> or a dedicated <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code> branch) stays lean while still referencing rich media.</p>

<h1 id="the-deployment-model">The Deployment Model</h1>

<ol>
  <li>Develop on main (or source). Track large assets with LFS.</li>
  <li>In CI (GitHub Actions), checkout with LFS so the runner downloads actual binaries.</li>
  <li>Build your site (e.g., Jekyll → _site/).</li>
  <li>Verify that the output contains no LFS pointers.</li>
  <li>Publish the built site to the gh-pages branch.</li>
  <li>In your repo, go to Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: Deploy from a branch, choose Branch: gh-pages, and Save.</li>
</ol>

</blockquote>

<h1 id="what-to-notice-important-caveats">What to Notice (Important Caveats)</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Pages won’t fetch LFS for you</strong>. The build pipeline must convert pointers → binaries before publishing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>gh-pages</strong> stores real binaries. They’re not tracked by LFS after deployment; they count toward repo/Pages limits. The Pages site limit is about <strong>1 GB</strong>. If your site is heavy, consider:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>External object storage + CDN (S3 + CloudFront, Cloudflare R2, etc.).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Optimizing images/video (transcode, compress, lazy-load).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Using the Pages “GitHub Actions” source (artifact-based deploy) instead of “branch” to keep heavy output out of your Git history.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>LFS quotas</strong>: Storage and bandwidth quotas apply. Monitor repo Settings → LFS.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Migrations</strong>: To move existing history into LFS, use git lfs migrate import –include=”*.mp4” (history rewrite; coordinate with teammates).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="quick-faq">Quick FAQ</h3>

<p><strong>Does LFS make Pages faster?</strong> Not by itself. It just keeps your source branch light. Optimize/serve media appropriately.</p>

<p><strong>Can I keep gh-pages small?</strong> Prefer the Pages Actions source (artifact deploy) or host large media off-repo.</p>

<p><strong>Do I need extra steps for private repos?</strong> The workflow above works for both; Pages for private repos requires GitHub Pro/Team/Enterprise and appropriate visibility.</p>

<p><strong>What if I don’t use Jekyll?</strong> Replace the build step with your tool (Hugo, Docusaurus, Next static export, Eleventy, VitePress, etc.). The LFS+deploy pattern is the same.</p>

<h2 id="入口即是一碗牛丼的安慰">入口即是一碗牛丼的安慰</h2>
<p>第一站，是最不能失败的「牛丼」。</p>

<p>那碗端上来的时候还在冒热气——米粒松紧刚好，酱汁是微甜带一点洋葱慢炖出来的温柔，牛肉薄而不散，油脂在灯光下反着轻微亮光。混着汤汁扒第一口，直接让大脑切换到 “安全模式”。</p>

<h2 id="滑蛋--土豆深度治愈组合">滑蛋 + 土豆：深度治愈组合</h2>
<p>旁边那份蛋与土豆——看似家常，却是加分 MVP。鸡蛋滑到像云，土豆糯到像在和酱汁握手，入口是层次分明的软。它不惊艳，但它让整顿饭的情绪基线提高了两个档。你会忽然觉得：啊，好像很多烦恼没那么急了。</p>

<h2 id="双重酱香厚实与收敛的对话">双重酱香：厚实与收敛的对话</h2>
<p>两盘“重口味”肉：一份是稍微勾芡、酱香厚重的；另一份（第二版）收汁更干，带一点焦化的边缘。前者像一个热情的拥抱，后者像一个淡定的点头。一起上桌，反而让人循环对比着吃，意外耐心。味觉就这样被训练成一台差分分析器。</p>

<h2 id="串烧与酒夜色加载进度-80">串烧与酒：夜色加载进度 80%</h2>
<p>夜快一点点塌下来，就该换串烧登场。铁签划破焦香的小爆点，脂肪被火焰卷过后留下的是带一点点脆的边缘。配上一口波本（是的，随意的一小杯），嗓子里升起一条温热的下坠线路，胃和脑同步被点亮。</p>

<h2 id="生鱼片的安静时刻">生鱼片的安静时刻</h2>
<p>和前面的“热”完全不同，寿司 / 生鱼片那一刻像有人突然帮夜晚按了静音。米饭温度刚好不过界，鱼肉是“软+弹”的中间态，蘸一点芥末与酱油融合后回甜。吃到这里，你会意识到：真正高级的放松，是可以在一桌喧闹里自带一个静音泡泡。</p>

<h2 id="labubu-的小插曲-">Labubu 的小插曲 🐾</h2>
<p>桌边还坐着一只 Labubu（当然，是它被“邀请”来的）。它那种永远兴奋又略欠揍的表情，莫名契合今晚的能量值。仪式感，有时候就靠这些“没必要但快乐”的道具来撑起。</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2025-08-22-resources/Labubu.jpg" alt="Labubu 今日营业" /></p>

<h2 id="夜色一切风味的背景层">夜色：一切风味的背景层</h2>
<p>最后走出店门，被上海夜晚的潮湿与霓虹兜头盖住。楼宇反光像水面，空气里还有食物残存的暖味。那一刻才意识到：味觉体验不是盘子里结束的，它会被城市的温度继续渲染一截。</p>

In 2D: $\mathbf{F}=\langle M,N\rangle$. In 3D: $\mathbf{F}=\langle P,Q,R\rangle$. A smooth curve $C$ is parameterized by $\mathbf{r}(t)$, $a\le t\le b$. A smooth surface $S$ is parameterized by $\mathbf{r}(u,v)$ on a domain $D_{uv}$. Unit normal $\mathbf{n}$ is chosen by orientation (right-hand rule when paired with boundary orientation). 1) Line Integrals Scalar line integral (with respect to arc length) \(\int_C f\,ds \;=\; \int_a^b f(\mathbf{r}(t))\,\|\mathbf{r}'(t)\|\,dt.\) Vector line integral (work) \(W=\int_C \mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{r} \;=\; \int_a^b \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}(t))\cdot \mathbf{r}'(t)\,dt.\) Work/energy interpretation: moving a particle through a force field $\mathbf{F}$ along $C$. “Is $\mathbf{F}$ conservative?” (in a simply connected open set) Equivalent tests: $\displaystyle \oint_C \mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{r}=0$ for every closed $C$. Path independence: $\int_{C_1}\mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{r}=\int_{C_2}\mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{r}$ for any two paths with same endpoints. There exists potential $f$ with $\mathbf{F}=\nabla f$. In 2D: $N_x=M_y$. In 3D: $\nabla\times \mathbf{F}=\mathbf{0}$. Finding $f$ when conservative (2D): Integrate $M=\partial f/\partial x$ in $x$, then determine the “constant in $x$” via $N=\partial f/\partial y$. 2) Green’s Theorem (2D) Let $C$ be positively oriented, piecewise smooth, simple closed curve bounding region $D$ and $M,N$ have continuous partials on an open set containing $D$. Circulation form \(\oint_C M\,dx+N\,dy \;=\; \iint_D \left(N_x - M_y\right)\,dA.\) Flux / normal form \(\oint_C \mathbf{F}\cdot \mathbf{n}\,ds \;=\; \oint_C (-N)\,dx + M\,dy \;=\; \iint_D \left(M_x + N_y\right)\,dA \;=\; \iint_D \nabla\cdot\mathbf{F}\,dA.\) Area corollaries \(ext{Area}(D)=\frac12\oint_C (x\,dy - y\,dx) \;=\;\oint_C x\,dy \;=\; -\oint_C y\,dx \quad (\text{choose any one}).\) 3) Surface Integrals Scalar surface integral Given $\mathbf{r}(u,v)$ on $D_{uv}$, \[\iint_S f\,dS \;=\; \iint_{D_{uv}} f(\mathbf{r}(u,v))\,\|\mathbf{r}_u\times \mathbf{r}_v\|\,du\,dv.\] For a graph $z=g(x,y)$: \(dS = \sqrt{1+g_x^2+g_y^2}\,dx\,dy.\) Flux of a vector field across a surface \[\iint_S \mathbf{F}\cdot \mathbf{n}\,dS \;=\; \iint_{D_{uv}} \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}(u,v))\cdot\left(\mathbf{r}_u\times \mathbf{r}_v\right)\,du\,dv.\] 4) Stokes’ Theorem (3D) Let $S$ be an oriented smooth surface with boundary curve $C=\partial S$ (positively oriented by the right-hand rule). If $\mathbf{F}$ has continuous partials, \[\oint_C \mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{r} \;=\; \iint_S (\nabla\times\mathbf{F})\cdot \mathbf{n}\,dS.\] 5) Divergence Theorem (Gauss) Let $E$ be a solid region with boundary surface $S=\partial E$ oriented outward, and $\mathbf{F}$ have continuous partials: \[\iint_S \mathbf{F}\cdot \mathbf{n}\,dS \;=\; \iiint_E \nabla\cdot\mathbf{F}\,dV.\] 6) Double &amp; Triple Integrals Double integral (Cartesian) \[\iint_D f(x,y)\,dA \;=\; \int_{x=a}^b\int_{y=g_1(x)}^{g_2(x)} f(x,y)\,dy\,dx \quad \text{or} \quad \int_{y=c}^d\int_{x=h_1(y)}^{h_2(y)} f(x,y)\,dx\,dy.\] Double integral (polar) Use $x=r\cos\theta,\;y=r\sin\theta,\; dA = r\,dr\,d\theta$: \[\iint_D f(x,y)\,dA \;=\; \int_{\theta=\alpha}^{\beta}\int_{r=r_1(\theta)}^{r_2(\theta)} f\!\big(r\cos\theta, r\sin\theta\big)\; r\,dr\,d\theta.\] Triple integral (Cartesian) \[\iiint_E f(x,y,z)\,dV \;=\; \int\!\!\int\!\!\int f(x,y,z)\,dz\,dy\,dx \quad (\text{order to fit }E).\] Triple integral (cylindrical) Use $x=r\cos\theta,\;y=r\sin\theta,\;z=z,\; dV=r\,dr\,d\theta\,dz$: \[\iiint_E f\,dV = \int_{\theta=\alpha}^{\beta}\int_{r=r_1(\theta)}^{r_2(\theta)}\int_{z=z_1(r,\theta)}^{z_2(r,\theta)} f(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta,z)\; r\,dz\,dr\,d\theta.\] Triple integral (spherical) Use $x=\rho\sin\phi\cos\theta,\; y=\rho\sin\phi\sin\theta,\; z=\rho\cos\phi,\; dV=\rho^2\sin\phi\,d\rho\,d\phi\,d\theta$: \[\iiint_E f\,dV = \int_{\theta=\alpha}^{\beta}\int_{\phi=\phi_1(\theta)}^{\phi_2(\theta)}\int_{\rho=\rho_1(\phi,\theta)}^{\rho_2(\phi,\theta)} f(\rho,\phi,\theta)\; \rho^2\sin\phi\, d\rho\, d\phi\, d\theta.\] 7) Change of Variables (Jacobian) In 2D If $(x,y)=(x(u,v),y(u,v))$ is one-to-one with nonzero Jacobian \(J=\frac{\partial(x,y)}{\partial(u,v)}= \begin{vmatrix} x_u &amp; x_v\\ y_u &amp; y_v \end{vmatrix},\) then \(\iint_D f(x,y)\,dx\,dy = \iint_{D^*} f\big(x(u,v),y(u,v)\big)\; \left|J\right|\,du\,dv.\) In 3D Similarly with $(x,y,z)=(x(u,v,w),y(u,v,w),z(u,v,w))$ and \(J=\frac{\partial(x,y,z)}{\partial(u,v,w)}= \det \begin{bmatrix} x_u &amp; x_v &amp; x_w\\ y_u &amp; y_v &amp; y_w\\ z_u &amp; z_v &amp; z_w \end{bmatrix}.\) 8) Curl and Divergence (Cartesian) \[\nabla\times\mathbf{F}= \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} &amp; \mathbf{j} &amp; \mathbf{k}\\ \partial_x &amp; \partial_y &amp; \partial_z\\ P &amp; Q &amp; R \end{vmatrix} = \langle R_y-Q_z,\; P_z-R_x,\; Q_x-P_y\rangle.\] \[\nabla\cdot\mathbf{F} = P_x + Q_y + R_z.\] Vector identities: $\nabla\times(\nabla f)=\mathbf{0}$, $\nabla\cdot(\nabla\times\mathbf{F})=0$. 9) Second Derivative Test (2D) Let $f_x=f_y=0$ at $(a,b)$. Define $ D=f_{xx}(a,b)\,f_{yy}(a,b)-\big(f_{xy}(a,b)\big)^2. $ If $D&gt;0$ and $f_{xx}(a,b)&gt;0$: local minimum. If $D&gt;0$ and $f_{xx}(a,b)&lt;0$: local maximum. If $D&lt;0$: saddle. If $D=0$: test inconclusive. 10) Lagrange Multipliers One constraint $g(x,y,z)=c$: Solve \[\nabla f=\lambda \nabla g,\qquad g(x,y,z)=c.\] Two constraints $g(x,y,z)=c,\; h(x,y,z)=k$: \[\nabla f=\lambda \nabla g+\mu \nabla h,\quad g=c,\quad h=k.\] 11) Flux (quick references) Across a plane curve $C$ (Green’s normal form): $\displaystyle \oint_C \mathbf{F}\cdot \mathbf{n}\,ds = \oint_C (M\,dy - N\,dx) = \iint_D \nabla\cdot\mathbf{F}\,dA$. Across a surface $S$: $\displaystyle \iint_S \mathbf{F}\cdot \mathbf{n}\,dS=\iint_{D_{uv}}\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}(u,v))\cdot(\mathbf{r}_u\times\mathbf{r}_v)\,du\,dv$. Closed surface $S=\partial E$ (Divergence Thm): $\displaystyle \iint_S \mathbf{F}\cdot \mathbf{n}\,dS=\iiint_E \nabla\cdot\mathbf{F}\,dV.$ 12) Common Regional Setups (quick memory) Disk/annulus: use polar $(r,\theta)$, $dA=r\,dr\,d\theta$.

<h2 id="红是伯克利跳动的心脏">红，是伯克利跳动的心脏</h2>
<p>伯克利在我眼里是红色的。</p>

<p>不是校园砖红的建筑，而是那种藏在日常里的热烈与躁动。
红，是午后晒得发烫的台阶。
红，是深夜还亮着灯的自习室 （不真， 是白天。
红，是和朋友辩论时那种眼里的光。
红，是热情洋溢的青春。</p>

<p>这个夏天的伯克利，不安静，却充满了生命力。</p>

<h2 id="灰是分别那天的天气">灰，是分别那天的天气</h2>
<p>这个夏天的最后一天，我送别了一位非常特别的朋友。
我们一起走过伯克利的街道，一起在钟楼下说再见。
没有煽情的话语，也没有过多的承诺，只是安静地道别，目送着彼此走向各自的方向。</p>

<p>那一刻，我感受到的是灰色。
不是冷漠的灰，而是那种淡淡的、潮湿的、像旧照片边缘褪色的灰。
天气明明很好，可我总觉得天有些阴，像是云层藏住了光。</p>

<p>灰，是结束时那种轻轻的痛感，是知道再见之后，各自都会走向不同人生的沉默。</p>

<h2 id="忙碌是什么颜色">忙碌是什么颜色？</h2>
<p>夏天的伯克利，真的太忙了。
从早到晚的课程、project、labs，还有数不清的todo list。
忙碌是什么颜色？我想是亮橙色的——像深夜屏幕的光，像便签纸上乱涂的笔记，像我们头脑风暴时快速闪过的灵感。</p>

<p>那种橙色，是燃烧，是疲惫，是青春最真实的模样。</p>

<h2 id="收获是金黄色的阳光">收获，是金黄色的阳光</h2>
<p>我也收获了很多。</p>

<p>收获了一个自己曾经不认识的我，
收获了新的朋友，新的城市，新的勇气。
我骑车穿过金门大桥，风吹乱头发，却觉得自己自由得像只鸟。
我在优胜美地抬头仰望，那些高耸入云的岩壁让我觉得，
自己虽渺小，却也踏实地存在着。</p>

<p>收获是金黄色的，像傍晚洒在脸上的暖光，像内心悄悄长大的感觉。</p>

<p>两个月，转瞬即逝。
明明才刚刚熟悉这个城市、这些人，这种感觉，却又要说再见了。</p>

<p>我们说：“慢慢来吧。”
可生活不给慢慢来的时间。
我们一点点靠近，又在最不舍的时候分开。</p>

<p>有些故事，还没写完就翻篇了。
可即使没能继续，它依然很美。</p>

<p>Recently, I had the opportunity to try out the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gpt-oss-20b</code> model, and the experience was nothing short of fantastic. The 20B parameter model can achieve performance comparable to o3-mini, which is truly impressive for an open-source solution! 🤯</p>

<p>One of the highlights was asking general questions, including technical topics like the Line of Sight feature in my 2D tile-based game 🎮.
